<h2>OpenSTV Help</h2>

<p><b>I. Overview</b></p>

<p>The single transferable vote (STV) is an election method that is
used to obtain proportional representation. STV is used for national
elections in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Malta, Australia, Scotland,
and New Zealand. In addition, many organizations use STV, including
the Church of England and the Green Party of the United States.
However, no two of the above use precisely the same definition of STV.
With the same set of ballots, these different methods could produce
different winners. STV can best be described as a category of
election methods and users of STV must specify precisely which version
of STV is to be used. The purpose of this software is to help
organizations use STV and also to specify precisely which STV rules
they will use.</p>

<p>The basic structure of an STV method can be described as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Establish the winning threshold.
    <li> Count the first place votes.
    <li> If one or more candidates have surplus votes (votes in excess
         of the winning threshold), then transfer the surplus votes.
         Otherwise, eliminate the last place candidate and transfer
         those votes. The only candidates who can receive votes are
         those who are under the winning threshold and not eliminated.
         If there are no further candidates on a ballot than that vote
         is "exhausted" and does not count towards any candidate.
    <li> Repeat step (3) until all of the winners are determined.
</ol>

<p>Different STV methods define more precisely how the above is
implemented. STV methods must define the winning threshold and also
how votes are to be transferred from candidates with a surplus and
from candidates who are eliminated. Specific implementations of STV
define both of these and may also modify the basic structure.</p>

<p>People have different points of view as to which STV method should
be used in a particular situation. For a group that values
simplicity, we recommend Scottish STV. It is the easiest method to
understand and it provides accurate proportional representation.
Another advantage is that OpenSTV's implementation of Scottish STV has
been validated against the counting software used in Scotland.</p>

<p>For a group that desires the most accurate proportional
representation, we recommend Meek STV. The transfer of votes is more
complicated with Meek STV, and thus more difficult to explain to the
voters. Meek is, however, generally accepted as the most accurate STV
method.</p>

<p>The rest of this document assumes that you already chosen the
particular STV method that you would like to use and guides the
process of using OpenSTV. OpenSTV provides two basic operations:</p>

<ol>
<li> Running an election with a ballot file.
<li> Creating or editing a ballot file that can later be used to run
an election.
</ol>

<p><b>II. Running an Election</b></p>

<p>To run an election, you must already have a complete ballot file.
If you do not have a complete ballot file, then you can create or edit
a ballot file as described below. To start the process, select "Run
Election..." from the File menu.</p>

<p>The first step is to select the file that contains the ballots and
the election method to be used. You do not need to specify the format
of the ballot file as OpenSTV will determine that automatically.</p>

<p>The next window allows you to specify more information, optionally
withdraw candidates, and to set options particular to the election
method chosen (if any). This window should be self explanatory.</p>

<p>The election results will appear in a new tab. You then have
several options for saving the results. You can copy and paste the
text into a different program, or using the File menu, you can save
the results in one of three formats. The text format is exactly what
you see on the screen. The html format can viewed in a browser. The
CSV (comma separated value) output is used by the Electoral Reform
Society and can be loaded into any spreadsheet program.</p>

<p>The File menu also allows you to close the tabs containing election
results; you can't close the console tab unless all results tabs have been 
closed. The font size in any tab can be changed to the desired size  
via the Options menu. If the election results are wider
than the window size, then choosing a smaller font size may allow for
easier viewing of election results.</p>

<p><b>III. Editing Ballots</b></p>

<p>OpenSTV has a built-in ballot file editor. If you would like to
create a new ballot file from scratch, select "New Ballot File..."
from the File menu. If you would like to edit an existing ballot
file, select "Edit Ballot File..." from the File menu.</p>

<p>When you create a new ballot file through OpenSTV, it will always
be in the BLT format, and you cannot save the ballot file in any other
format. The first step in creating a new ballot file is to enter
the names of the candidates, and this process is self explanatory.
Once you enter the candidates' names, you are presented with the
editing window.</p>

<p>If you are editing an existing file, then you can select ballot
files in BLT format or in text format (described below), and OpenSTV
will always save the file in the same format (you can't save in a
different format). After selecting the ballot file to edit, you are
presented with the editing window. You can have multiple ballot
editing windows open at a time.</p>

<p>The ballot editing window contains two tabs. The Ballots tab
allows you to view and edit ballots, and this process should be
self-explanatory. OpenSTV only accepts valid ballots, and an empty
ballot is valid. You don't need to rank all of the candidates on each
ballot, but you cannot skip rankings and you cannot give two or more
candidates the same ranking. The Log tab creates an audit trail of
how the ballots have been edited, and you can save the log to a file.</p>

<p>The File menu allows you to save the ballots and the log or to
save them under different filenames, but you can't change the file
format. The File menu also allows you to append an existing ballot
file to the ballot file you are currently editing. To append, the two
ballot files must have the same number of candidates, the same number
of seats, and identical candidate names.</p>

<p><b>IV. Ballot File Formats</b></p>

<p>Two ballot file formats are supported: BLT format and text format.</p>

<p>The BLT format is preferred and is the format used by the Electoral Reform
Society. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
    4 2          # four candidates are competing for two seats
    -2           # Bob has withdrawn (optional)
    1 4 1 3 2 0  # first ballot
    1 2 4 1 3 0
    1 1 4 2 3 0  # The first number is the ballot weight (>= 1).
    1 1 2 4 3 0  # The last 0 is an end of ballot marker.
    1 1 4 3 0    # Numbers in between correspond to the candidates
    1 3 2 4 1 0  # on the ballot.
    1 3 4 1 2 0
    1 3 4 1 2 0  # Chuck, Diane, Amy, Bob
    1 4 3 2 0
    1 2 3 4 1 0  # last ballot
    0            # end of ballots marker
    "Amy"        # candidate 1
    "Bob"        # candidate 2
    "Chuck"      # candidate 3
    "Diane"      # candidate 4
    "Gardening Club Election"  # title
</pre>

<p>The text format is a simple format that is easily created with any
test editor. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
    Amy Bob Chuck
    Bob Amy
    Chuck
    Chuck Bob
</pre>
<p>The first ballot lists Amy first, Bob second, and Chuck third. Note
that candidate names must be alphanumeric. You can also add a weight
to a ballot by prefixing it with a number and a colon:</p>
<pre>
    10: Amy Bob Chuck
    5: Bob Amy
    Chuck
    2: Chuck Bob
</pre>

<p><b>V. Advanced Use</b></p>
<p>Download and install the Linux version of OpenSTV to use OpenSTV
from the command line or via scripting.</p>
<p>The <code>runelection.py</code> command runs an election for the
given method and ballot file.  Results are printed to stdout.</p>
<pre> runElection.py [-d] [-r report] [-t tiebreak] method ballotfile

    -d: enable debug
    -r: report format: text*, html, csv 
    -t: tiebreak method: random*, alpha, index
        *default
</pre>

<p>The <code>runelection.py</code> command runs an election for the
given method and ballot file.  Results are printed to stdout. The
following methods are available:</p>

<blockquote>Approval<br>
Borda<br>

<p>You can also write your own Python scripts to run elections. To do
this, you would import OpenSTV's Python modules into your own Python
program. Use runElection.py as an example of how to write your own
scripts using OpenSTV.</p>
